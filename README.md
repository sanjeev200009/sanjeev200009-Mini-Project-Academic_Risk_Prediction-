## Project Overview

This project helps educational institutions identify students who may be at high risk of academic failure based on various demographic, academic, and behavioral features. The application allows teachers and administrators to:

- Predict student risk using a trained machine learning model
- Explore key data trends and insights
- Provide actionable recommendations for high-risk students
- Visualize model performance and feature importance

The system is tailored for **Sri Lankan students**, using relevant demographic and educational features.
